  <h1>The Hound Walker</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the website for the Hound Walker. I am an ex-teacher who has a real love of dogs and the outdoors.</p>
  <p>Working in Leyland and surrounding areas I offer reliable and safe services for your dogs. The services include solo and group walks for your dogs, bespoke walking for those owners who work shifts, including last minute callouts due to work commitments.</p>
  <p>Daily walks can be tracked so you can see the adventures of your furry friends through the Facebook page. I have a canine first aid certificate, DBS checked and fully insured.</p>
